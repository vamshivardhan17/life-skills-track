# Listening and Assertive Communication

## 1.What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

Active listening is a crucial skill that involves fully engaging with the speaker, understanding their message, and providing appropriate feedback. Steps to practice active listening:

- **Give your full attention**: Focus entirely on the speaker and eliminate distractions. Maintain eye contact and avoid interrupting or thinking about your response while they are speaking. Show genuine interest in what they are saying.

- **Show non-verbal cues**: Use affirmative non-verbal cues like nodding, smiling, and leaning slightly forward to signal that you are actively listening. These gestures encourage the speaker to continue and feel heard.

- **Use verbal cues**: Provide occasional verbal cues, such as saying "I see," "I understand," or "Go on." These responses indicate that you are following their message and encourage them to share more.

- **Avoid interrupting**: Wait for the speaker to finish their thought before responding. Interrupting can disrupt their train of thought and discourage them from sharing further.

- **Ask clarifying questions**: When the speaker finishes speaking, ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand their message fully. These questions show your interest and help you gather more information.

- **Summarize and paraphrase**: Periodically summarize or paraphrase what the speaker has said to confirm your understanding. This demonstrates active engagement and allows the speaker to clarify any misunderstandings.

## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

According to Fisher's model, Reflective Listening involves actively listening to the speaker and then reflecting back their feelings and thoughts in your own words. The key points of Reflective Listening are:

- **Active Engagement**: Reflective Listening requires giving your full attention to the speaker and being fully present in the conversation.

- **Empathy**: It involves understanding and acknowledging the speaker's emotions and perspectives, showing that you care about their feelings.

- **Avoiding Judgment**: Reflective Listening avoids judging or criticizing the speaker's thoughts and emotions. Instead, it focuses on accepting and understanding their point of view.

- **Using Your Own Words**: After the speaker shares their thoughts and feelings, the listener responds by paraphrasing or summarizing what they heard, using their own words.

- **Affirming and Validating**: Reflective Listening affirms the speaker's feelings and experiences, making them feel heard and valued.

- **Encouraging Further Sharing**: By actively reflecting back the speaker's words, Reflective Listening encourages them to share more and express themselves more openly.
